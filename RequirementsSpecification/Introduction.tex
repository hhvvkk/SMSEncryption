Reliable communication in certain parts of South Africa is not always possible in remote locations using GSM, 3G or other similar mediums.

Therefore, communication normally occur using SMS - which generally is not very secure. This can cause a loss in confidentiality, availability and integrity to the communicators.

The benefit of this application is that you are able to communicate securely, knowing that you are reducing the risk of the confidential information being obtained by an unauthorised party.
