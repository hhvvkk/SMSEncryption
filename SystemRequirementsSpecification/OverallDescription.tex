\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product perspective}
 %Describes the environment of the system

\subsubsection{Description}
SMSEncryption is a new product which can be used in conjunction with any mobile text manipulation application, such as the general keyboard input used by the different mobile operating systems, or any other text manipulating application, capable of using the basic GSM character set - should you require encryption and decryption functionality for secure communication between two parties.
\vspace{12pt}\\
The GSM character set contains a limited amount of characters, which will, in turn, limit the encryption methods we can make use of, as many encryption algorithms greatly increase both the size of the message, and the number of different characters used. Making use of these encryption algorithms that generate large amounts of characters will be infeasible, as sending large SMSes will be expensive.
\subsubsection{System interfaces}

\subsubsection{User interfaces}
 The user interface is what will allow the user to type a message, encrypt it, copy the ciphertext, and paste it into the application that will send the message. On the receiving end, the message received will be copied, and pasted into the SMSEncryption application, which will be used to decrypt the received message. This ensures integrity of the message, as only users of the application will be able to encrypt/decrypt the message in the agreed upon way.
\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
The software will run on a mobile device that allows user interaction and text manipulation.
\subsubsection{Software interface}
 The software interface will make use of operating system features, such as a clipboard on the device to facilitate 'copying' and 'pasting' of texts or ciphertexts.
\subsubsection{Memory}
The device needs minimal storage space on the device for a local database and the application is 2mb large.
\subsubsection{Operations}
\begin{itemize}
\item User-initiated operations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create user account
\item Edit user account
\item Add contact
\item Edit contact
\item Remove contact
\item Enter message
\item Encrypt message
\item Decrypt message
\item Synchronise contact
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


%Note:
%Required : Functionality must be provided if service is provided
%Extends : Extended functionality which can be provided, but not always.

\subsection{Product functions}
The application is divided into 3 core functionalities: Admin, Messaging, and Contacts.

\subsubsection{Admin}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user should be able to create a user account in the application.
\begin{itemize}
\item On first use of the application, a username and password (with confirmation of password) must be created that will ensure user authentication for future use of the application.
\item Only a single user account is allowed per device.
\end{itemize}
\item The user shall be able to edit his/her user account.
\begin{itemize}
\item Should it be required, once authentication has validated the user (i.e. he/she is "logged-in") the user can edit his/her account details.
\end{itemize}
\item The application will make use of local authentication to verify the user before logging him/her in.
\begin{itemize}
\item Every time a user wants to use the application, the set password must be provided along with the login details.
\item If the provided password (and related details) are entered correctly, the user gains access to the application.
\item If the password provided is found to be incorrect three times in a row, the application will lock for a specified amount of time - preventing access from an unauthorised user.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Messaging}
\begin{itemize}
\item Before creating a message within the application, the user must select the intended contact/receiver of the message.
\begin{itemize}
\item The selected contact's details will be used to perform encryption.
\end{itemize}
\item When creating a message within the application, the text can be either typed, or pasted in via the device "clipboard".
\item Once a message text has been entered into the application (via any method listed above), it can be edited within the application.
\item Once editing the message text has been finalized, the message should be encrypted.
\item The application must allow the encrypted message to be copied onto the device clipboard.
\begin{itemize}
\item The encrypted message (ciphertext), can then, by the user, be copied and pasted into an application that will send the ciphertext to the desired receiver; any messaging application can be used.
\end{itemize}
\item If an encrypted message is received (and pasted into the application), the application must be able to decrypt the ciphertext.
\begin{itemize}
\item Before ciphertext can be pasted into the application, the sender of the message must first be selected as a contact. The sender's contact details will be used to decrypt the ciphertext.
\item The desired receiver should be able to decrypt the message back into its original plaintext.
\end{itemize}
\item The message length should be displayed.
\begin{itemize}
\item This is to ensure that message length does not exceed the maximum amount of 144 characters.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Contacts}
\begin{itemize}
\item A user must be able to add a contact to the application.
\begin{itemize}
\item In order for communication to take place between two devices, i.e. two contacts, they first need to be synchronized.
\item A user adds what is called a "contact". The application will require the following: the name of the contact, a locally generated unique word/key (to be provided to the other user with which messages will be exchanged), and the contact's unique generated word/key (which has to be received from the contact with which communication will take place).
\item Before the two contacts can be synchronized with one another, both users must provide their unique key to each other. 
\begin {itemize}
\item This will synchronize communication between the devices.
\item If both users add each other as a contact at relatively the same time, synchronization can take place at a greater speed (as the synchronization process on both devices are dependent on one another).
\end {itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item The application must allow a contact to be edited once added.
\item The application must allow removal of a contact that has been added.
\item The application must allow resynchronization of contacts, should desynchronization occur.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User characteristics}
%Assumptions about the users, their background, how
%much training they will need
%? e.g., different user interfaces for expert vs. novice users
%? Only user characteristics that affect the software
%requirements
\begin{itemize}
\item There will be only one user class who will have full access to all the features provided by the application after local authentication, since the application only allows for a single user account to be created per device.
\item It is assumed that the user has proficient knowledge on how to use the "clipboard" of their device; i.e. copy message text from applications, such as the standard SMS application, and paste it within this application.
\item It is also assumed that users perform the device synchronization phase correctly; before exchanging messages, as there is no way for the device to detect errors in synchronization - such as an incorrect, or older (already used) key.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constraints}
%Anything that will limit the designer's options
\begin{itemize}
\item The encrypted message length is limited to 160 characters, regardless of plaintext message length.
\item The application must make use of the basic GSM character set.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions and dependencies}
%List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) 
%that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. 

\begin{itemize}
\item It is assumed that the amount of characters in the basic GSM character set is 128 for the 7-bit encoding used in GSM.
\item It is assumed that the devices being used allows has clipboard functionality (copy/paste functionality) for text between different interfaces/applicaitons.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Apportioning of requirements}
The following are possibilities that can be added to future versions of the sytem:
\begin{itemize}
\item SMS capability from within the application.
\item Compatibility for other operating systems, such as iOS or Windows Phone.
\end{itemize}
