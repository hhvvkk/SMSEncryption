\subsection{Performance requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application should operate in a timely manner. The user should not be made to wait an unreasonable amount of time (this variable can be affected by the system environment e.g. resource availability)
\begin{itemize}
\item The application is expected to encrypt a message in less than one second
\item The application is expected to decrypt a message in less than one second
\end{itemize}
\item The encryption method used must ensure secure communication via compromised communication methods
\begin{itemize}
\item The encyprion method used should have an entropy value of less than 1\%
\end{itemize}
\item The applcaiton must make use of local authentication
\begin{itemize}
\item A user's password must always remain masked; when logging in, or even when editing the user account details
\item A user's password should be encrypted or stored as a hash value within the application database
\item Contact information stored by the application must not be obtainable by unauthorized users
\item Contact information should be encrypted to ensure that it is not readable by unauthorized users
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logical database requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item The user's password must be hashed using a SHA-256 hash function
\item The data stored by the application should only be viewable by an authorised user
\item Contact data must be encrypted to ensure confidentiality - using an applicable hash function
\item Every user has zero or more contacts associated with it
\item Once a user account is deleted, all data associated with that account, including all saved contacts, will be deleted
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=13cm]{diagrams/LogicalDatabase.png}
\end{center}

\subsection{Design constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Message length : DC1}\\
\textbf{(Source: Bernard Wagner, Priority: High)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Due to the fact that the primary messaging service that the client intends to use is SMS, the amount of characters per message is limited to 160 characters in total
\item The encryption process uses 6 characters for a failsafe, and 10 characters to embed the next key to be used for future communication
\item This means that plaintext entered by the user is limited to 144 characters
\item To maintain consistency, we enforce this as the maximum length of messages which the application can encrypt, regardless of the messaging application used to send the message
\end{itemize}
\item{The usable characters : DC2}\\
\textbf{(Source: Bernard Wagner, Priority: High)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The usable characters that can be encrypted by the application is limited to the GSM character set, because the primary messaging service that this application is developed for is SMS.
\end{itemize}
\item{Application resource requirementsr : DC3}\\
\textbf{(Source: Bernard Wagner, Priority: High)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application should function efficiently, with the least amount of resource usage
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application must be secure, as is stipulated in Appendix D: Secure Sesign Principles
\item The application must conform to the Android and iOS respective platform design principles; these can be found in Appendix E, Design principles
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software system attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application should run until the user closes it
\item Any information stored by the application should be static and exist as long as the application is open or said information is edited/removed
\item The ciphertext should decrypt back into its original plaintext
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Availability}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user should be able to use the application regardless of runtime, and should not be made to wait while the application performs a function
\item The application should not interfere with any other applications that could be running simultaneously on the device
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Security}
\begin{itemize}
\item A secure encryption (and decryption) method will be used for the localised application database
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
\begin{itemize}
\item The source code should be simplistic, maintainable, and readable/documented
\item The application should not act in unpredictable ways
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Portability}
\begin{itemize}
\item The client has requested that different versions of the application be developed to execute on different mobile operating systems: namely Android and iOS
\end{itemize}
