\subsubsection{Contacts Functions}
\begin{itemize}

\textbf{(Source: Bernard Wagner, Priority: High)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Before communicating with someone, the receiver must be added as a contact, in order to be able to communicate with that user.
\item Inputs: The user inputs a contact's Name,number,local key and the contacts key.
\item Outputs: The contact is created and stored or the apllication shows an error message if input details were invalid.
\end{itemize}

\item{Edit Contact : FRQ11}\\
\textbf{(Source: Bernard Wagner, Priority: Medium)}
\begin{itemize}
\item A contact must be editable once it has been added.
\item Inputs: The user selects a contact which they wish to modify the details for or to delete from the application.
\item Outputs: The selected contacts details will be modified and stored or the contact will be deleted.
\end{itemize}
 \includegraphics[width=13cm]{diagrams/StateDiagrams/EditContactStateDiagram.png}
\item{Synchronise Contact : FRQ12}\\
\textbf{(Source: Group Deliberation, Priority: High)}

\item The user shall be able to synchronise with a contact at any time after they have been added.
\end{itemize}
\item{Remove Contact : FRQ13}\\
\textbf{(Source: Bernard Wagner, Priority: High)}
\begin{itemize}
\item A user must be able to remove a contact.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application should operate in a timely manner, the user should not be made to wait an unreasonable amount of time (this variable can be affected by the system environment e.g. resource availability).
\begin{itemize}
\item Expected time the applcaiton should take to decrypt is less than one second.
\item Expected time the applicaiton should take to encrypt is less than one second.
\end{itemize}
\item The encryption method must be secure.
\begin{itemize}
\item The Encyprion method used should have an entropy of less than 1\%.
\end{itemize}
\item The applcaiton must be secure.
\begin{itemize}
\item A user’s password must not be viewable as to prevent unauthorized use of the application.
\item A user’s password should be encrypted or stored as a hash value.
\item Contact information stored by the application must not be obtainable by unauthorized users.
\item Contact information should be encrypted to ensure that it is not readable by unauthorized users.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logical database requirements}

\subsection{Design constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Message length : DC1}\\
\textbf{(Source: Bernard Wagner, Priority: High)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Due to the fact that the primary messaging service which the client intends to use is SMS this limits the input size of the text to 160 characters. 
\item The encryption process uses 6 characters for a fail safe and 10 characters to embed the next key.
\item This means plaintext must be limited to 144 characters.
\item To maintain consistency we enforce this as the maximum length of messages which the application can encrypt, regardless of the intended messaging application.
\end{itemize}
\item{The usable characters : DC2}\\
\textbf{(Source: Bernard Wagner, Priority: High)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The usable character which can be encrypted by the application is the GSM character set because the primary intended messaging service that the client wishes to use is SMS. 
\end{itemize}
\item{Application resource requirementsr : DC3}\\
\textbf{(Source: Bernard Wagner, Priority: High)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application should function efficiently with the least amount of resource usage.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application must be secure, as is stipuled in Appendix D, Secure design principles.
\item The Application must conform to the Android and iOS design principles for each respective platform, these can be found in Appendix E, Design principles.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software system attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application should run until the user closes it.
\item Any information stored in the application should be static and exist as long as the application is open or said information is removed/edited.
\item The ciphertext should decrypt into its plaintext.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Availability}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user should be able to use the application as long as it is running and should not be made to wait while the application performs a function.
\item The application should not interfere with any other applications which are running on the device.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Security}
\begin{itemize}
\item A secure encryption and decryption method will be used for the localised database.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
\begin{itemize}
\item The source code should be maintainable (simplistic and readable/documented).
\item The application should not act in unpredictable ways.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Portability}
\begin{itemize}
\item The client has requested that different versions of the application be developed to execute on different operating systems namely Android and iOS.
\end{itemize}
